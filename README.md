# Bags

This repo contains of two types of Bags, ArrayBag and LinkedBag

# ArrayBag

Let's say you have a bag, and it can hold only 10 elements, no matter how big, no matter how small, the size doesn't matters, the only thing that matters is the quantity.
This is how ArrayBag works.

ArrayBag has 3 methods: grab, insert, remove

# Grab
grab() - returns a RANDOM item from the ArrayBag.

# Insert
insert(Object item) - inserts a new Object item in the Bag.

# Remove
remove(Object item)- looks for specific item, if finds one, removes it and returns true. Otherwise returns false.

# LinkedBag
LinkedBag has same methods as an ArrayBag, the only difference between them is that if ArrayBag can only have 10 items inside, LinkedBag doesn't have such a problem. 
You can have as many items as your memory can provide space with in the LinkedBag.
